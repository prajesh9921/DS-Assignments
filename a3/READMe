To run the code follow the steps
step 1: pip install mpi4py numpy
step 2: mpirun -np <number_of_processors> python DistributedSum.py
        Replace <number_of_processors> with the desired number of MPI processes you want to run.
        Eg: mpirun -np 4 python DistributedSum.py
        
Explanation of output: the output of 5050 is correct for the given code. The code is designed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n using MPI (Message Passing Interface) for distributed computing.

In this case, the input array contains numbers from 1 to 100, and the code distributes the array elements among multiple processes using the Scatter() function. Each process receives a portion of the array and calculates the sum of its local elements. Then, the local sums are collected and reduced to a final sum using the Allreduce() function.

The expected output for an input array containing numbers from 1 to 100 is indeed 5050, which represents the sum of all the numbers in the array.

Therefore, the code is functioning correctly, and the output of 5050 is expected.

Step1: sudo apt install mpich
Step2: mpiexec --version
Step3: pip install mpi4py
Step4: nanp ~/.basshrc
Add the following lines
export PATH="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openmpi/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openmpi/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH"
Step5: source ~/.bashrc
Step6: mpiexec -n <no_of_processors> python DistributedSum.py
check the python version and execute the above command accordingly. If this does not work check the path to python by using the command (which python)
then run the code using mpiexec -n <no_of_processors> <path to python file> DistributedSum.py
